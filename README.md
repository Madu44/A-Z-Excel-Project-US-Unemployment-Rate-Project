# US-Unemployment-Rate

In this project, I analysed and interpreted the recent unemployment data in the United States from 1976 to 2022 and providing recommendations for policymakers. I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle, cleaned and analyzed the data to identify trends such as changes in the overall unemployment rate, correlations between labor force and unemployment, and changes in location demographics of the unemployed, employed, and labor force. I conducted statistical analysis to identify the factors driving changes in the unemployment rate and provided insights and recommendations to policymakers using the McCandless method of data presentation. My analysis identified key trends and insights such as the steady decline of the unemployment rate since 2010, which increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but has recently decreased to 4% of the labor force in 2022. However, the data is incomplete because there is no information on sectors and genders to identify the sector with the highest unemployment as well as genders and age ranges. Overall, my analysis provided policymakers with insights and recommendations to help address current unemployment trends in the United States.
